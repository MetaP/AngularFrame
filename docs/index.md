# AngularFrame
This [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) website contains the documentation for the [MetaP](https://github.com/MetaP)/[AngularFrame](https://github.com/MetaP/AngularFrame) GitHub repository.

***AngularFrame*** is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) application framework for [model-driven development](/doc/guide/model-or-domain-driven.md).

Currently, this project is still in an embryonic state.

## Objectives
- Create a basic framework to be used as the starting point of a new Angular project
- Provide a set of basic components, services, directives and code that can be used as such or serve as a good starting point for custom development
- Define and illustrate good practices
- Promote the notion of domain-driven GUI development
- Raise the level of abstraction to make artifacts more reusable

## Documentation
- [Reference](./reference/reference.md) - Overview of the available framework features.
- [Guide](./guide/guide.md) - Discusses the design and implementation of framework features, provides design patterns and best practices and proposes conventions.
