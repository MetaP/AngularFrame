# AngularFrame

With this project I want to share my [Angular](https://angular.io/) experience.

Currently, it still is in an embryonic state.

## Objectives
- Create a basic framework to be used as the starting point of a new Angular project
- Provide a set of basic components, services, directives and code that can be used as such or serve as a good starting point for custom development
- Define and illustrate good practices
- Promote the notion of domain-driven GUI development
- Raise the level of abstraction to make artifacts more reusable

## Available Components
Check the [Overview](/doc/reference/overview.md).
