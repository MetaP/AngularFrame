# AngularFrame

An [Angular](https://angular.io/) application framework for [model-driven development](/doc/guide/model-or-domain-driven.md)

## Objectives
- Create a basic framework to be used as the starting point of a new Angular project
- Provide a set of basic components, services, directives and code that can be used as such or serve as a good starting point for custom development
- Define and illustrate good practices
- Promote the notion of domain-driven GUI development
- Raise the level of abstraction to make artifacts more reusable

Currently, this project is still in an embryonic state.
