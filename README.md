# AngularFrame

An [Angular](https://angular.io/) application framework for [model-driven development](/doc/guide/model-or-domain-driven.md)

Currently, it still is in an embryonic state.

## Objectives
- Create a basic framework to be used as the starting point of a new Angular project
- Provide a set of basic components, services, directives and code that can be used as such or serve as a good starting point for custom development
- Define and illustrate good practices
- Promote the notion of domain-driven GUI development
- Raise the level of abstraction to make artifacts more reusable

## Documentation
- [Reference](/doc/reference/reference.md) - Overview of the available framework features.
- [Guide](/doc/guide/guide.md) - Discusses the design and implementation of framework features, provides design patterns and best practices and proposes conventions.
