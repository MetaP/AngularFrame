# Model/domain-driven design/development
There are a lot of terms in the model- or domain-driven arena.

Let's have a look at following terms:
- model-driven design
- domain-driven design
- model-driven development
- domain-driven development

## Model-driven versus domain-driven
Model-driven is more general than domain-driven. Domain-driven is a specific type of model-driven where the model represents the concepts of a domain. 

## Design versus development

The development variants stress the fact that the model elements play a role during the build and execution of the software — as opposed to only during the requirements and design phases.
Some actual run-time artifacts — like forms, fields, classes — can be representations of domain entities — like person, address.
